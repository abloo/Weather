# Step 1: Build the React application
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) into the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application files into the container
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the app using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built React files from the build stage to Nginxâ€™s HTML directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx when the container launches
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
